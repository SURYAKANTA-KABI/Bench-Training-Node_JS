What is a Module in Node.js?
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
A set of functions you want to include in your application.

Include Modules
To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:

var http = require('http');
Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:

You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.

Example
Create a module that returns the current date and time:

exports.myDateTime = function () {
  return Date();
};
