Node.js as a File Server
The Node.js file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer.

To include the File System module, use the require() method:

var fs = require('fs');
Common use for the File System module:

Read files
Create files
Update files
Delete files
Rename files
Read Files
The fs.readFile() method is used to read files on your computer.

Assume we have the following HTML file (located in the same folder as Node.js):

demofile1.html

<html>
<body>
<h1>My Header</h1>
<p>My paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Create a Node.js file that reads the HTML file, and return the content:

Example
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    res.write(data);
    return res.end();
  });
}).listen(8080);

*Create Files
The File System module has methods for creating new files:

fs.appendFile()
fs.open()
fs.writeFile()
The fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created
The fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created
The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file, containing the specified content, will be created

*Update Files
The File System module has methods for updating files:

fs.appendFile()
fs.writeFile()
The fs.appendFile() method appends the specified content at the end of the specified file
The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content

*Delete Files
To delete a file with the File System module,  use the fs.unlink() method.

The fs.unlink() method deletes the specified file

*Rename Files
To rename a file with the File System module,  use the fs.rename() method.

The fs.rename() method renames the specified file
